				What started as a dream among a group of passionate individuals soon
				turned into one of the most sought-after wedding photography and
				cinematography teams in Kochi, Kerala, and beyond. When we combined our
				skills and vision, Pepper Green Wedding was born—a brand dedicated to
				storytelling through timeless photography and films
				<br />
				<br />
				We don’t believe in just claiming to be the best; instead, we let our
				work, creativity, and dedication speak for us. Every wedding we capture
				is a new opportunity to hone our craft and create magic, ensuring that
				your most precious moments are preserved with beauty and authenticity.
